What time Mr. Long does not devote at present to collections is taken up with routine small work that could be done by an intelligent Chinese under his supervision. Due to the present economy measures, he has no such assistant. Do not mistake me in deducing that Mr. Long has suggested such an assistant for himself. He has made no mention of the matter, but when I asked him what he thought of the idea, he agreed with me that it would release him for more important work. I then went into the matter with him, merely on the basis that some day it might be possible. We talked of it something along these lines: Mr. Long could obtain an efficient assistant whose salary would amount to approximately G.$130.00 a month. I do not wish to be too optimistic, but I believe that by hiring such an assistant, the money spent would be returned to us many times over in the next five years. I know there was some talk of Mr. Long leaving the Company during the last three or four months. These rumors were totally unfounded, and I suspect were largely due to the efforts of one Janes. I think we can put our minds at rest.",

I am sure he will find his visit to that country an interesting one. Naturally, Ernest has been very busy seeing all there is to be seen in the short time at his disposal in England. I was hoping that I should have seen more of him, but his time has not permitted it, as I should have liked to have taken him about and shown him some of the sights of London and the neighboring country.

I want to thank you by letter for your many courtesies, especially your letters and the equipment furnished by Dr. Nordholz. Although I have not found occasion to use it myself, it came in handy a number of times on the boat. If you would be interested, I shall write to you from time to time regarding various people and conditions I meet with. Please give my regards to Mrs. Harris, and tell her I am sorry I am not going to Russia. I am writing this sitting in my office, which is a very nice one looking directly upon the Strand and Australia House. Tonight I shall write you a really good letter. Had lunch today with Alexander Roger's son at the Savoy - very enjoyable. Dinner again tonight with Pleven and so on. How do you like the way I am keeping things open so far? We have a real pea-soup fog today. This trip is going to do me more good than 50 years in college. Lots of love, Ernest Gann",

It will only be a matter of time before the majority of the civil officials in India will be natives. I bring this up because after considerable traveling, I have come to the conclusion that too much attention, (alias sales energy), is poured upon the already overburdened European, and the natives are left to shift for themselves in the matter of their buying education. It is nonsense to say that the native does not represent an important market for articles over ten cents in value. I do not mean by this that a rickshaw boy or a camel boy would be interested financially in a handset telephone or an Excel stove. There are, however, a great number of middle-class and wealthy natives in every country; merchants and such like.

These stop signs have made considerable progress here, and I understand they have orders and potentialities for a great many more, both in England and in surrounding countries. I understand that in England, only two million homes out of twelve million are electrically equipped. A new grid system has recently been put in operation throughout Northern England, and undoubtedly, as a result of this, many homes will install electricity. The opportunities to manufacture and sell electrical equipment in conjunction with this new use of electricity seem to be very promising. I noticed particularly, in going through the Liverpool factories, the make-up of the tanks where the dipping takes place. In Chicago, these tanks are made of wood, and the appearance not only is untidy, but I understand is not as efficient as the Liverpool ones.

This was based on the theory (I suppose a good one) that in the following years, they would have assured business. Take, for instance, the city of Tokyo. If you desire a telephone in this city, you must first pay a premium. They sell telephone numbers exactly as we sell stocks, so to speak, only the telephones are worth something. The premium for number 1839 may be lower today than it was yesterday, and so on. Now, this is the astounding fact: the present average premium for the privilege of having a \"number\" is SEVEN HUNDRED YEN! Approximately two hundred and ten dollars!

Captain Cavell is going to join me there about a week after my arrival. He cannot make the trip over with me as he has to go to Hong Kong on business. I have very little idea as to how much time I shall spend in Japan. It will largely depend on how much I like the country, and from all I hear, I shall enjoy my stay there very much. However, I think three weeks or a month will satisfy me. After that time, I plan to go directly to San Francisco. The fact that the steamer stops there anyway will allow me a day in Honolulu. From San Francisco, I want to take a few days and run down to Los Angeles to see a lot of my friends who are making movies down there now. The trip should not cost much, and I am very anxious to have a look at Hollywood. From there, I shall go up the coast to Vancouver, visiting the lone theme, and would appreciate it very much if either you or Mr. Adams, or perhaps both, would write the necessary letters of introduction and make any other arrangements you might think proper.

I am not only dealing with the telephone business but also politics, economics, and human interest.

You will, no doubt, be pleased to learn that he looked and expressed himself as being very fit.

As I had arranged for him to dine with me last night, I asked him to postpone his visit to Germany so that he could join us for dinner and meet Mr. Wright. As a result, I hope it will be possible to stop the price cutting which has been going on in connection with Post Office stores and eventually develop in connection with rural areas unless such an arrangement is arrived at. However, since this matter involves questions of policy, I propose to consult Mr. Moore's views on this subject before developing the position any further. In the meantime, your son will have the opportunity of going over the Bell Works. Before closing this personal letter, I would like to say that I have been impressed with the amount of common sense I think is possessed by Ernest, and I feel the result of his world tour will give him an international outlook, which I hope will be to considerable advantage in connection with his future endeavors.

My dear Ernest: Frankly, your telegram is rather embarrassing for me to answer. The position is this: I would be delighted for Price to go to Berlin with you, and if it is only a question of giving him a holiday for that purpose, I would be ready to ask Mr. White to make the necessary arrangements. However, for some months past, I have maintained very strong pressure to reduce expenses, and, frankly, if Price's expenses, including fares, hotel bills, etc., are to be borne by the Company, I think it would be very bad for the morale of the organization if I were to allow it. On the other hand, if you have enough money to take care of his expenses, then you may take this letter to Mr. White and tell him I would agree to Price going to Berlin, so long as we know where to reach him by telephone or telegraph. But make it clear to Mr. White that the Company will not be involved in any expense. I am sure you will not resent my frankness and that you will realize fully the many reasons why I am obliged to take the view set out in this letter.

Mr. Pleven had told me he was coming, but the first intimation of his arrival was a telegram from Paris stating he was coming the next day, some two months after I had news from Pleven.

All of us in Antwerp were charmed by him, and some of my Belgian friends' wives whom he met must have heaved a sigh of regret when he left, as he has great fascination for the fair sex but appears to be totally unconscious of the effect he makes without any great effort. He went through the factory here and met all of the staff; Mr. White, in order to give him an idea of how the wheels turn, asked him to attend one of our \"exploitation meetings\" where we air in common our grievances and discuss methods of trying to sell the innumerable things we have to sell to people who have no money at prices below cost, and still make a profit.

      "content": "To begin with, confining themselves almost wholly to whipping their own tremendous problem into some semblance of success, Trotsky, (who, though in Turkish exile, is the very active head of the true \"Commune Internationale\"), is bending every effort to spread his doctrine throughout the world. It must have been a considerable blow to his plans to have Hitler so successfully destroy his active and power-gaining machine in Germany. If Communism now exists in Germany, and there is no hope to suppose it does not, it is only in the very darkest, most isolated corners, and it will be some time at least before they are heard from again. Due to the recent agitation over the Jewish problem, I endeavored to remain as impartial as possible and after having examined the conditions rather thoroughly, cannot help but be in sympathy with the movement.

I soon found, however, that he was extremely tired of traveling and being alone. Instead of leaving him at a hotel, I obtained a furnished apartment for him in the same building as my own. The manageress of these apartments fixed him up very comfortably, with the result that he is now installed in Shanghai in his own apartment. This, of course, gives him much more room and a sense of belonging to the place, and incidentally, it is much cheaper than a hotel. These apartments run a food service so that he has everything he wants, and he can wander up and see me whenever he wishes. So far, after only three days, he has not had time to absorb Shanghai with its complicated arrangement of International Settlements. But in a few days, he will get it all straightened out in his mind, and living, as he now does, as a resident of the French Concession will be a great help to him in understanding conditions here. At the present moment, he is with Mr. Long, and a little later on today, Long and Barrington will take him around our exchanges here, and so on. I have put him in the way of getting some riding, and thus, one way and another, he will, I hope, obtain a comprehensive grasp of this city and its environs. With regard to his future plans, when he arrived here, he very badly wanted to travel up to Peking and from there, through the late war zone, right through Manchuria (or Manchoukuo as the Japanese now call it) and so through to Vladivostok. But I have dissuaded him from attempting such a journey. In the first place, trains are not running, and to organize mule transport and try to get through will only result in being captured by bandits. All the practical value of such a journey, even if it could be accomplished safely, would be nil. I am arranging to take him to Nanking. He may go to Peking, but to go there now is probably just a waste of time and money.

The task is not one to be passed off lightly, but I assure you I am making some progress both in this direction and as regards general political and telephone conditions. With the very kind assistance and advice of Captain Cavell, I have been learning about the current state of things in this chaotic country. He was kind enough to meet me upon my arrival and has been almost constantly with me since the moment I landed. Mr. Long returned from Nanking yesterday, and I met him this morning. I have now met and conversed, both socially and in a business way, with the entire staff of the Chinese Offices. This morning, I also inspected the exchanges at Nantao and Chapei. When I have my material fully prepared and I feel that I understand the various situations and ramifications better, I shall write you a full report. Regarding my personal movements, I have taken an apartment at a reasonable rate in the same building as Captain Cavell. Not only does this enable me to be closer to him, but I am thus able to absorb some of the atmosphere of life in China. I expect to remain in Shanghai for possibly the next ten days. From here, I shall go to Nanking for a day or so and then up to Peking. From the advice I am able to gather, three days should be sufficient for that city, whereupon I shall return to Shanghai and sail for Japan. There is a strong possibility of Captain Cavell accompanying me to Japan as he has some Totalisator negotiations there. I am planning to take the $500.00 cash that you arranged for me here, but in all probability, I shall not need it at all. I am only taking it in case I should run a hundred dollars or so short; it will save you the expense of cabling to Japan. Financially, physically, and mentally, I am pretty well off, and from the present look of things, I should be back in Chicago sometime in September. I will, as you suggested, go to Vancouver. Tentatively, I am planning on landing in San Francisco, proceeding up the coast to Vancouver, and returning to Chicago by way of St. Paul. A letter addressed c/o the N. Y. K.

ERNEST GANN SUBJECT: OULED-NAIL GIRLS As requested by you during our very important conference some two months ago, I herewith submit to you a report on the Ouled-Nail girls as observed by me in the cities of Casa-Blanca and Fez-Medina, Morocco. 9 It was only by dint of constant effort on my part that I am able to at last report to you upon this subject.

There was very little to say at any rate as I have been on board ship ever since I wrote my last letter to you. We have been sailing and sailing on a seemingly endless voyage for the past ten days and still have six more to go before we reach Colombo. The passage has not been too tedious, however, due mainly to the very pleasant company. Somehow the days seem to go, one by one, in endless succession. The sun sets in the foaming wake of the ship and the moon comes up a near neighbor to the Southern Cross.

G., this is certainly one of the most comprehensive sound-amplifying systems installed in any part of the world. The first problem was presented by the fact that in the Swiss Parliament each delegate speaks from his own seat and not from a tribune. Thus, no central installation of microphones would have served. For the same reason, the usual arrangement of loud-speakers diffusing at a fairly high volume level over the area in which the delegates sit was impracticable. After lengthy experiments, a satisfactory solution was reached on the following lines: Two hundred microphones are installed, each delegate being provided with his own instrument mounted on the desk immediately in front of his chair. Thus, no matter in which part of the House a delegate speaks, his voice is picked up by his own microphone and taken to a special control panel. Then, no less than one hundred loud-speakers are installed below the desks of the delegates, one loud-speaker being placed between each pair of chairs. In addition, headphones are installed for the use of the Press, and are also available for the delegates. The microphone control panel is one of the most ingenious features of the whole installation, and since it has to deal with inputs from the two hundred microphones, each of which is switched separately, it has the general appearance of a small telephone exchange. The operator sits at this control panel, and as the various delegates rise to address the House, their microphones are brought into operation, since for various reasons it is not desirable that all microphones should be \"alive\" at the same time. The loud-speakers are also switched in small groups, these switches being linked with the microphone switches in such a manner that when any microphone is connected the group of loud-speakers in its immediate vicinity is switched off, thus obviating the possibility of acoustic reaction between the various loud-speakers and microphones. It occurred to me that there might be some field for a similar installation in America. At any rate, I am going to investigate it fully and will make a later report at that time. I was pleased to note that the \"Georgic,\" newest of the White Star ships, has a complete P. A. X. installation. The second engineer informed me that it was a great convenience, both to himself and the rest of the officers in the execution of their work. (E. K. G.)",

I think you will like to know that your son, Ernest, left for Paris by aeroplane yesterday in continuation of his journey.

He met most of the principal officials of the Companies here and at Liverpool, and I think he gathered some useful experience and information. I may say that he made a very good impression on us all, and we were glad to do what we could for him. I have arranged a number of letters of introduction for him for the various countries which he is visiting, and I hope thereby it will contribute to make the rest of his journey pleasant and profitable.

Prominently displayed in the window of a stationery store in New York (47th St. between 5th and 6th), I noticed a device which, though I do not believe it could be manufactured by the Company, at least should be of some interest to the Directors. It consisted of a small cylindrical lock that fitted in the finger-hole of the calling dial on an automatic telephone. Its purpose was to prevent unauthorized calls in cities where extra charges are made for excess calls, such as New York and Chicago. In operation, the dial could be locked with a small key, thus preventing anyone from using the telephone who did not have the consent of the owner. The device was called \"SAV-A-CALL,\" and after enquiry, I determined that it was manufactured by SAV-A-CALL Inc., 19 W. 44th Street, New York City. The retail price was one dollar.

It occurred to me that there might be some no longer being used in the various advertising departments, and if so, perhaps they could be sent to them. The Chief Engineer suggested to me that if some of the engineers employed by the group had written technical papers concerning the products for engineering journals, he would like copies of the papers. He would then be able to get them published in various engineering journals in this territory. Although I think it is mainly due to the fact that they have been dealing heretofore in such things as cutlery, where a catalogue is an easy proposition, they made one suggestion that I think might be used, with modifications.

It would be impossible to accomplish this in six or twelve hours, so if we could possibly arrange it, the idea, of course, meeting with your approval, I think this would be wise. Perhaps I am wrong, but it would be a good idea for me to call on Mr. Adams very soon after my arrival. Now, I definitely do not want to do this without having a long talk with you first. At any rate, if you will write me c/o the N. Y. K. Line, San Francisco, I can get your ideas on the subject.

I agree with your idea, and think it a very good one, that I go up to Montreal on my return and see the Phillip's plant. I have now done so much of this sort of thing that it is becoming an expert routine with me.

He has not been urging me to, but has only tried to show me, very much as you would do, what the situation is. As you say, such a visit will be beneficial. I am very glad to hear that business is picking up a bit. This seems to be true of almost every place in the world I have visited, with the possible exception of Austria and Spain. These two countries, however, are so much dead wood anyway, and there is something more basic than depression that is ruining them.

My assistants, however, arranged for a two days' visit to the Liverpool Factory which, no doubt, Ernest has told you about. From all accounts, he has made quite a good impression here, and judging from the very nice note I received from him, he evidently fully appreciates the character of his welcome.
