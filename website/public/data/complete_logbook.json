Just about all anybody can bear first class, anybody but a Spanish peasant is strongly advised against attempting the trip under any other section of railroad society. The trip being between Madrid and Lisbon, there must be several hundred little stations. The use of the word \"stations\" is purely for lack of a better one as in no sense of the word can the places this train stops really be considered as worthy of the name. By no means should anyone labor under the impression that \"Sunny Spain\" and equally idyllic Portugal are incapable of rousing old man winter. But, bring along your warmest coat. Of course, the weather was \"unusual\"...\n\nOne builds up a strong feeling against the Spaniards and the Portuguese... for being such bloody fools. But the feeling is different for each. You don't mind it at all when you witness a Portuguese putting overmuch oil in a gasoline motor. You know that he does it, that it may make more smoke and thus, in his mind, run better. The diesel ferry between Barreiro and Lisbon smokes like a Hudson River tug struggling against both wind and tide. The Portuguese, not being used to seeing a smokestack without a plume of black smoke, will damn well provide one. Somehow you don't mind this in the Portuguese. They are just enthusiastic children possessed of an overwhelming curiosity to learn and have a try at everything new. The Spanish are merely maddeningly incompetent. All Portuguese, from the fisher-folk to the members of the President's cabinet, make a sincere effort to understand and to help a foreigner; the Spanish do not make any such effort.\n\nFor a slight insight into the Portuguese character, take out a camera on one of the little side streets of Lisbon. Directly you will be surrounded by a gaping group of all ages. They will not make themselves objectionable and this is not the first camera they have ever seen. Silently, positively enrapt in curiosity, they will watch you manipulate the thing... the more complicated its operation, the better. They have an intense desire to see how this particular camera is operated. When you have done, they will smile slightly and turn away... their curiosity satisfied.\n\nThe city of Lisbon is built upon a number of steep hills. Its harbor, one of the most colorful in the world, has changed but little since the day Vasco Da Gama set sail on his record-breaking voyage. The Phoenician and Moorish influences are evident everywhere. The steep little streets have numerous houses that only a Moor could have conceived.

I was, unfortunately, able to spend only a few minutes with him, but sufficiently long to realize that he seems to be having a very interesting time and is acquiring quite a lot of useful information. You will, no doubt, be pleased to learn that he looked and expressed himself as being very fit.\n\nIt also so happened that through mutual friends, I have just been able to make contact with Mr. Wright, who now is in control of the Bell Works here and apparently the responsible man for all their Continental interests. As I had arranged for him to dine with me last night, I asked him to postpone his visit to Germany so that he could join us for dinner and meet Mr. Wright. As a result, I hope it will be possible to stop the price cutting which has been going on in connection with Post Office stores and eventually develop in connection with rural areas unless such an arrangement is arrived at. However, since this matter involves questions of policy, I propose to consult Mr. Moore's views on this subject before developing the position any further. In the meantime, your son will have the opportunity of going over the Bell Works.\n\nBefore closing this personal letter, I would like to say that I have been impressed with the amount of common sense I think is possessed by Ernest, and I feel the result of his world tour will give him an international outlook, which I hope will be to considerable advantage in connection with his future endeavors.\n\nWith very kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nG.

As I had arranged for him to dine with me last night, I asked Ernest to postpone his visit to Germany so that he might join us at dinner and meet Mr. Wright. As a result of our friendly gathering, I hope it will be possible to make some arrangement to stop the price cutting which has been going on in connection with Post Office stores and which will eventually develop in connection with rural exchanges unless such an arrangement is arrived at. But as this matter involves questions of policy, I propose to obtain Mr. Moore's views on this subject before developing the position any further. In the meantime, however, your son will have the opportunity of going over the Bell Works.\n\nBefore closing this personal letter, I would like to say that I have been impressed with the amount of common sense that I think is possessed by Ernest, and I feel sure that the result of his world tour will give him a sound practical international outlook which I hope one day can be used to considerable advantage in connection with overseas exploitation.\n\nBelieve me, with very kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,  \nW.

Almost every time I settle down to do some writing, I feel that I must move on and see some more of the world, and of course, I must then put a stop to whatever I am doing. I am now getting so ga-ga from looking at the world that I am not sure whether I am looking at Vesuvius or Fujiama. I think that one reaches the saturation point after a while, a point where new countries fail to interest and new things fail to impress. That is one of the chief reasons why I have chosen to leave Europe and get East of Suez.

I soon found, however, that he was extremely tired of traveling and being alone. Instead of leaving him at a hotel, I obtained a furnished apartment for him in the same building as my own. The manageress of these apartments fixed him up very comfortably, with the result that he is now installed in Shanghai in his own apartment. This, of course, gives him much more room and a sense of belonging to the place, and incidentally, it is much cheaper than a hotel.  \n\nThese apartments run a food service so that he has everything he wants, and he can wander up and see me whenever he wishes. So far, after only three days, he has not had time to absorb Shanghai with its complicated arrangement of International Settlements. But in a few days, he will get it all straightened out in his mind, and living, as he now does, as a resident of the French Concession will be a great help to him in understanding conditions here.  \n\nAt the present moment, he is with Mr. Long, and a little later on today, Long and Barrington will take him around our exchanges here, and so on. I have put him in the way of getting some riding, and thus, one way and another, he will, I hope, obtain a comprehensive grasp of this city and its environs.  \n\nWith regard to his future plans, when he arrived here, he very badly wanted to travel up to Peking and from there, through the late war zone, right through Manchuria (or Manchoukuo as the Japanese now call it) and so through to Vladivostok. But I have dissuaded him from attempting such a journey.  \n\nIn the first place, trains are not running, and to organize mule transport and try to get through will only result in being captured by bandits.

I used to think it was romantic to let the big liners go their way and confine my august company to the little blighters... they don't make 'em too big for me nowadays. I never get on a boat now without looking up its tonnage. You can tell a lot more than just the size of a boat from its tonnage, I have found.

Perfectly miserable weather, rain and wind and whatnot. Would love to see this city in the summertime when one can ride through the canals of an evening without contracting pneumonia.

Immediately got myself taken off the pension list and now shall eat in more peace. Afternoon found me completely lost in some little tortuous streets but as I once was a Boy Scout, I finally found my way home again and topped off the afternoon with reading all about the famous women of Austria in a tasty little volume I am now engrossed in.

Gann.  \nShanghai, China.  \nJune 16, 1933.  \n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am currently in China and at the present moment, I am trying to distinguish one Chinese warlord from another. The task is not one to be passed off lightly, but I assure you I am making some progress both in this direction and as regards general political and telephone conditions.\n\nWith the very kind assistance and advice of Captain Cavell, I have been learning about the current state of things in this chaotic country. He was kind enough to meet me upon my arrival and has been almost constantly with me since the moment I landed. Mr. Long returned from Nanking yesterday, and I met him this morning. I have now met and conversed, both socially and in a business way, with the entire staff of the Chinese Offices.\n\nThis morning, I also inspected the exchanges at Nantao and Chapei. When I have my material fully prepared and I feel that I understand the various situations and ramifications better, I shall write you a full report.\n\nRegarding my personal movements, I have taken an apartment at a reasonable rate in the same building as Captain Cavell. Not only does this enable me to be closer to him, but I am thus able to absorb some of the atmosphere of life in China. I expect to remain in Shanghai for possibly the next ten days. From here, I shall go to Nanking for a day or so and then up to Peking. From the advice I am able to gather, three days should be sufficient for that city, whereupon I shall return to Shanghai and sail for Japan.\n\nThere is a strong possibility of Captain Cavell accompanying me to Japan as he has some Totalisator negotiations there. I am planning to take the $500.00 cash that you arranged for me here, but in all probability, I shall not need it at all. I am only taking it in case I should run a hundred dollars or so short; it will save you the expense of cabling to Japan.\n\nFinancially, physically, and mentally, I am pretty well off, and from the present look of things, I should be back in Chicago sometime in September. I will, as you suggested, go to Vancouver. Tentatively, I am planning on landing in San Francisco, proceeding up the coast to Vancouver, and returning to Chicago by way of St. Paul.\n\nA letter addressed c/o the N.Y.K. Line office at Tokyo will undoubtedly reach me. Any final words of wisdom which you may like to impart to me before my Pacific crossing had, perhaps, better be included in that letter.\n\nI hope you and mother are enjoying the boat to the fullest extent. Please give my best regards to Messrs. Adams, Gary, Homeyer, Harris, and Benoist. All my love to you and mother.\n\nLove,  \nERNEST",

There was very little to say at any rate as I have been on board ship ever since I wrote my last letter to you. We have been sailing and sailing on a seemingly endless voyage for the past ten days and still have six more to go before we reach Colombo.  \n\nThe passage has not been too tedious, however, due mainly to the very pleasant company. Somehow the days seem to go, one by one, in endless succession. The sun sets in the foaming wake of the ship and the moon comes up a near neighbor to the Southern Cross. Day by day we throb over a furnace-like glassy sea, unbroken except by an occasional flying fish or sun-seeking shark.  \n\nThe heat is so great that it is difficult to even think coherently, so that my efforts will never be missed. We stay in the shade as much as possible and puff, blow, wipe, and complain, but the heat unrelentingly spoils first one shirt and then another.  \n\nI really don't know what to talk about because my last letter described everything up to the moment of sailing, and since then there has been nothing but the boredom of ship's life. I am enclosing this letter in an envelope full of things that I think might be of interest to you. I am getting extremely anxious to get to Japan. I think the first of September should see me back in Chicago, but I have long ago given up prophesying my whereabouts as every time I do so, I fail to fulfill my prophecies.  \n\nYou mentioned in your cable that I received in Rome, that there was a job waiting for me in the factory. Perhaps I am wrong, and this is no time or place to discuss it, but I do not believe this is a good idea. In times when experienced men are being laid off, it would, I think, be stretching things a bit too far to take on a comparative greenhorn. The reason for the job presentation would be obvious to everyone from the lowest screw-maker on up. Not only would it put you and the administration in a bad light, but, if you will forgive my saying so, it would make things extremely difficult for me. It is not fair to either one of us.  \n\nThe more I think about it, the more it seems to me the proper course to take is for me to stay as far away from Theo. Gary Company as possible.

The whole attitude of the people, the geographical layout, the conceptions of ethics and traditions, coupled with nationalistic feeling that sometimes almost amounts to a frenzy, is against any comparison.\n\nTherefore, try to forget America, try to forget that you are a citizen in that country, even that you are of American birth, and you will gain a much clearer and more valuable opinion of present-day Europe. Remember also, that in addition to the difficulties brought on by the depression, Europe at this time is little short of a seething cauldron of national unrest and military spite. Europe was a match-box that required only a spark to ignite it in June 1914. If it was a match-box then, it is a living, breathing, large-sized box of machine gun bullets now.\n\nWeek by week the conditions change. Not long ago, Italy (i.e., Mussolini, because he is Italy) was throwing tender words back and forth with France and turning cold looks of disapproval and disdain at Germany. Now, the reverse is true. Signor Mussolini seems unable to say enough nice things to Herr Hitler, and while the two are busy throwing bouquets back and forth, France sits upon her bayonet-studded front door.\n\nLittle Belgium, playground of all the powers, remains to be seen.

My last bulwark weakening, I was finally prevailed upon to undergo the sundry vaccinations and inoculations. The doctor was delighted at the prospect of downing a foreign disease and set to work with a will, sticking needles full of all manner of strange fluids in my arms.

I also mention, as romantically as possible, the coast of Arabia, the spices of Ceylon, the shipping of Singapore. I have but a few brief comments to make on these at this time.  \n\nThe coast of Arabia is like nothing you ever saw before. You never laid eyes, nor for that matter have I, on so many, many miles of nothing at all. Usually, a first-class blast furnace in operation, somewhere just over the hills, adds to its attractiveness as a location for a summer home.  \n\nThe so-called \"spices of Ceylon\" are \"spicy,\" I grant you that. If you can walk a hundred yards without slipping on some betel nut juice, you are indeed an agile person. As to the shipping of Singapore, I can only say that there is damned little of it these days.  \n\nI want to acquaint you with my plans (which always seem to be changed at the last minute) for the future. I shall spend, approximately, another week here in China (**) and then shall go on to Japan. Captain Cavell is going to join me there about a week after my arrival. He cannot make the trip over with me as it is necessary for him to go to Hong Kong on business. I have very little idea as to how much time I shall spend in Japan. It will largely depend on how much I like the country, and from all I hear, I shall enjoy my stay there very much. However, I think three weeks or a month will satisfy me. After that time, I plan to sail directly to San Francisco. The fact that the steamers call there anyway will allow me a day in Honolulu. From San Francisco, I want to take a few days and run down to Los Angeles to see a lot of my friends who are making movies down there now. The trip should not cost much, and I am very anxious to have a look at Hollywood. From there, I shall go up the coast to Vancouver, visiting the offices there, and I would appreciate it very much if either you or Mr. Adams, or perhaps both, would write me the necessary letters of introduction and make any other arrangements you might think proper.  \n\nFrom Vancouver, I shall return directly to Chicago, stopping off a day in St. Paul. Now, one thing I am very desirous to arrange. Before I get back to Chicago, I want to spend at least a day, if not two, with you. I want to have a long talk with both of you and get the situation straight in my mind before I face the people in Chicago. In view of this, I thought it might be possible to send the \"Nagerac\" to Milwaukee. I could then get off at Milwaukee instead of Chicago and accompany you down to our home.  \n\n(**Already changed!

One does as one pleases always, provided it does not inconvenience a fellow citizen, and that is never done. The prostitute sits next to the judge, the baker chats with the newspaper vendor... anything is within the law if it does not interfere with one's brothers... and so it is a city of love, because love hurts no one.

To get along socially, to transact business, to do anything in Europe, whether you are in France or not, it is necessary to speak French. It is useless without a proper knowledge of this language. Most Europeans speak one language or two besides their own... invariably one of these is French. As a result, if one can speak it, one can engage in an intelligent conversation with almost anyone on the Continent. It is a great pity that Americans are not forced to learn more than one language... personally, I refuse to be one of them. At present, I speak what might be called \"sufficient Spanish\"... it is enough to get along. I am determined in this, however.

Both Holborn and Mayfair have the new automatic equipment, but the Central exchange I found the most interesting. I also spent the entire afternoon in the Overseas exchange, where I had the privilege of talking to South Africa.  \n\nMr. Gillings, of Automatic Electric Company, was kind enough to spend the day showing me around, and also gave me the enclosures which I am sending on to you. You will note that the British telephone subscribers' list shows a great increase from July to November. I talked with several men in an attempt to find out why such growth has taken place. As you know, the British telephones are controlled by the Government, which has instituted a somewhat extensive advertising campaign. These men attribute the increase to advertising.  \n\nI am also sending you various samples of advertising that I was able to pick up this afternoon.  \n\nAnybody who says there is more glamour to the stage than to certain telephone exchanges has certainly not had the privileges I had today.  \n\nI am now studying a report of the General Manager of the Liverpool factory, and also the Zurich Agreements, and I am attempting to learn all I can while I am here. Under separate cover, when I leave London, I shall send you a resume of the various important people I have met and talked with, and my impressions of them all.  \n\nMr. Pleven has gone out of his way to be nice to me, and has rather taken over the position of a Professor of Telephony.  \n\nDo not worry about what you mentioned in your cable, because I have taken special pains to make that understood.  \n\nLove to Mother.  \n\nYour son,  \nErnest",

Both\nHolborn and Mayfair have the new automatic equipment,\nbut the Central exchange I found the most interesting.\nI also spent the entire afternoon in the Overseas ex-\nchange, where I had the privilege of talking to South\nAfrica.\n680 e\nMr.Gillings, of Automatic Electric Company, was kind\ncenough to spend the day showing me about, and also gave\nme the enclosures which I am sending on to you. You\nwill note that the British telephone subscribers' list\nshows a great increase from July to November. I talked\nwith several men in an attempt to find out why such a\ngrowth has taken place. As you know, the British tele-\nphones are controlled by the Government, which has in-\nstituted a somewhat extensive advertising campaign.\nThese men attribute the increase to advertising.\nemist\nI am also sending you various samples of advertising\nthat I was able to pick up this afternoon.\nng.\nAnybody who says there is more glamour to the stage\nthan to certain telephone exchanges has certainly not\nhad the privileges I had today. ell\n11 bo able to\nI am now studying a report of the General Manager of en\nthe Liverpool factory, and also the Zurich Agreements,\nand I am attempting to learn all I can while I am here.\nUnder separate cover when I leave London I shall sendam\nyou a resume of the various important people I have met\nand talked with, and my impressions of them all.\n#leep, 800 wr\nang letter\nMr. Pleven has gone out of his way to be nice to me,\nand has rather taken over the position of a Professor\nof Telephony.\nLove,\nDo not worry about what you mentioned in your cable, be-\ncause I have taken special pains to make that understood.\nLove to Mother.\nYour son\nErnest",
